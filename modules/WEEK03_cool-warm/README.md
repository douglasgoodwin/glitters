# Lecture on cold and warmth in materials

Why do some materials feel cool to the touch, even at room temperature? Why do others feel warm? Why do others feel neutral? Today we will look at some examples, melt some ice, try to pass a ball through a ring, and offer some ideas about how to talk about heat and materials.

An iron ball made so that it will just pass through a ring will not pass after it has been heated.

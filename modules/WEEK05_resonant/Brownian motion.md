# Brownian motion and what holds water together

but first: plot the temperature of water with ice cubes. 

## Brownian motion demo

1. two pint glasses filled with water: one cold, the other hot
2. drop some ink into the cold water. observe.
3. now drop some ink into the warm water. observe.

can you account for this?

random walks and diffusion.

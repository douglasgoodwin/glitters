# GLITTERS | The cannonball problem

We have studied how large pieces come to the top of an aggregate. This time we will consider what happens when all the pieces are roughly the same size. How will they pack? What patterns will they make? 

All materials are made up of aggregates at some level, and aggregates share common behavior at scales between shipping containers to clay particles. How do you think malted milk balls arrange themselves in a container? Please draw your thoughts before we open the container and see what's inside.

Many crystal structures are based on a close-packing of a single kind of atom, or a close-packing of large ions with smaller ions filling the spaces between them. The cubic and hexagonal arrangements are very close to one another in energy, and it may be difficult to predict which form will be preferred from first principles. Carl Friedrich Gauss proved that the highest average density – that is, the greatest fraction of space occupied by spheres – that can be achieved by a lattice packing is:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{3{\sqrt {2}}}}\simeq 0.74048.} {\frac {\pi }{3{\sqrt {2}}}}\simeq 0.74048.

This problem has a practical dimension. What is the most efficient way to pack cannon balls for use in war? The problem was posed in the 16th century to Queen Elizabeth's advisor Sir Walter Raleigh. This is the same Raleigh who introduced Tobacco and potatoes to Great Britain. Sir Walter worked with Thomas Harriot on what he called **The Cannonball Problem**. 

There are different kinds of efficiency. There is a difference between the efficiency of stroing the greatest number of cannonballs in a square area (where the first layer is 3x3 or 4x4) and an irregular area. 

Johannes Kepler continued worked on the problem in the 17th century. Kepler's conjecture is that no packing of spheres of the same radius in three dimensions has a density greater than the face-centered (hexagonal) cubic packing. This claim was first published by Johannes Kepler in his monograph "The Six-Cornered Snowflake" (1611) – a treatise inspired by his correspondence with Thomas Harriot.

The Kepler conjecture says that no arrangement of equally sized spheres filling space has a greater average density than that of the cubic close packing (face-centered cubic) and hexagonal close packing arrangements. The density of these arrangements is around 74.05%.

Kepler did not have a proof of the conjecture, and the next step was taken by Carl Friedrich Gauss (1831), who proved that the Kepler conjecture is true if the spheres have to be arranged in a regular lattice. 

After Gauss, no further progress was made towards proving the Kepler conjecture in the nineteenth century. In 1900 David Hilbert included it in his list of twenty-three unsolved problems of mathematics. It forms part of Hilbert's eighteenth problem.

in 1969, Hungarian mathematician László Fejes Tóth thought he’d figured out one simple method: If each sphere is in contact with as many others as possible, the packing would be the densest achievable. But he couldn’t prove it.

Tóth started with what mathematicians call the “kissing number.” Imagine placing a penny on a table and putting as many pennies as you can touching it — or, in mathematical parlance, “kissing” it. You’ll find that exactly six pennies fit, forming a hexagonal pattern. As a result, the kissing number in two dimensions is six. This pattern can be extended to cover the entire table, with each penny surrounded by six others.

Now do the same thing in three dimensions: Take an orange and arrange as many oranges as possible kissing it. It turns out that you can’t fit more than 12, so the kissing number in three dimensions is 12. Unlike with pennies, though, the 12 oranges won’t fit snugly around the central one; there’s a bit of room to spare, so the oranges can jiggle into different positions. As a result, if you extend this pattern out to fill space, with each ball surrounded by 12 others, the jiggliness will give you a lot of choices about how to arrange the balls.

Grocers stack fruit by laying the bottom row of the bottom layer first. They then put the next row in the crevices between the oranges of the first row, the following row in the crevices of the second row, and so on. This process ends up creating a hexagonal pattern, with each orange touching six others in its layer. 

In 1999, Thomas Hales of the University of Michigan announced a proof of the Hexagonal Honeycomb Conjecture, which says that regular hexagons as in Figure 1 provide the least-perimeter way to enclose infinitely many unit areas in the plane. Although widely believed and often asserted as fact, this conjecture eluded proof until 1999. 

Questions remained until 2003 when Hales started the Flyspeck project: an effort to vindicate his proof through formal verification. His team used two formal proof software assistants called Isabelle and HOL Light, both of which are built on a small kernel of logic that has been intensely scrutinised for any errors – this provides a foundation which ensures the computer can check any series of logical statements to confirm they are true.

“It has been a huge effort,” says Alan Bundy of the University of Edinburgh, UK, who was not involved in the work. He adds that he hopes Flyspeck’s success will inspire other mathematicians to start using proof assistants. 

The solution?

I gave you a square-base solution. This was deceptive, and you instinctively came up with a more efficient packing that leads to a three-sided pyramid. This solution is more efficient. The orange sellers' stacking falls into the face centred cubic lattice category, This is the densest possible packing of (to be precise) perfect, equal sized, hard spheres.

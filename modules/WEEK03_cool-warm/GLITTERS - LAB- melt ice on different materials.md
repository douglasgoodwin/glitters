# GLITTERS | LAB: melt ice on different materials

Three blocks

1. a cool block
2. a neutral block
3. a warm block

Put the blocks in a place where everybody can see them. Place the O-rings on each block and then an ice cube. Now, I would like you to place bets on which block will melt the ice first. cool, neutral, or warm (1, 2, or 3 )?

The first cube will melt within two minutes. Is that what you expected? Can you account for the differences?

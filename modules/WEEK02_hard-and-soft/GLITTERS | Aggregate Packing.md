# GLITTERS | Aggregate Packing

But first, look at this interactive: [The Scale of the Universe - Interactive](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1203/scaleofuniverse_huang.swf?bordercolor=white)

# I loved your drawings, thanks! I loved them so much that I want to do it again. 

---

# We have talked about aggregates and how granular convection reorders the pieces on truck rides from New Jersey. Here's what you learned:

1. large pieces float up to the top
2. small pieces go down
2. weight has little effect

---

# now let's talk about what's going on at the bottom. How do those pieces pack together?

I would like you to make two drawings today that show how pieces are pack together. 

---

# The first one is gumballs, the second one square mints in a can. Pack them as tightly as you can.

## what did you learn? did any patterns emerge?

---

# aggregate packing is something that you will see on every scale. 

---

# types

1. primitive / simple cubic
2. body-centered
3. face-centered

# can you organize your gumballs into each lattice structure? how about the mints?

---

# how much energy is needed to coax them into these structures?

can you imagine a situation where each structure might be the most efficient packing?

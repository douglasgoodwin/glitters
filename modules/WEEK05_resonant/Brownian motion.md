# GLITTERS: What attractive force holds water together?

but first: plot the temperature of water with ice cubes.

| time 	| temp. | note 						|
|--- 	|--- 	| --- 						|
| 0:00	|	 	| add ice cubes 			|
| 0:05	|	 	| 	 						|
| 0:10	|	 	| 	 						|
| 0:15	|	 	| 	 						|
| 0:20	|	 	| 	 						|
| 0:25	|	 	| 	 						|

## Brownian motion demo

1. two pint glasses filled with water: one cold, the other hot
2. drop some ink into the cold water. observe.
3. now drop some ink into the warm water. observe.

can you account for this?

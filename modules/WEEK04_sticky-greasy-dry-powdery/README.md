# glitters oct 12 | surfaces: sticky greasy dry and powdery

1. review from last week
2. new assignment: sign up to present investigations
4. LAB: What would paper look like to a flea?
3. LECTURE on surface tension, surfactants, capillary forces, and other surface qualities
4. DEMONSTRATION: floating--and sinking--a paperclip
5. next week: resonance


## transition from last week

## what makes something sticky?

1. van der Waals forces
2. friction
3. magnetic force
4. electrostatic force
5. mechanical forces
6. gravity

## example sticky things:
1. tape (van der Waals)
2. mortar (friction)
3. magnets (magnetism)
4. static electricity (electrostatic)
4. burrs, velcro (mechanical)
5. the pyramids (gravity)


## questions
1. can any of these forces account for the surface tension we see in water??
2. what are capillary forces? and how do capillary forces related to surface tension?
2. what is surface tension (surfActants)

## themes

# Lecture on Surfaces

sidebar: what is friction?

## what makes something greasy?

1. van der Waals forces (graphite)
2. hydrophobic (oil)
3. reduces friction
4. high viscosity (separating two surfaces)
5. non-polar

## what makes something dry?

1. dessicant
2. hydrophilic

## what makes something powdery?

1. powder?
